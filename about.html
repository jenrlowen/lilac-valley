            <h1>About Us</h1>
    
            <p>At Lilac Valley Farmstay, nature’s charm intertwines with comfort. Nestled among the rolling green hills of the Blue Mountains, we offer a serene escape from the bustling city. Whether you’re seeking a peaceful getaway or an authentic agricultural experience, we’ll be sure to supply you with the best hospitality and an overwhelming number of memories that will stick with you for a lifetime.</p>
    
            <p>Accommodation at Lilac Valley Farmstay has been renovated and designed to blend in with its natural surroundings, while also providing a cozy and comfortable place for our guests to spend their nights. Not only are you able to get a good night’s sleep, you’ll have full access to facilities such as a kitchen, fully stocked with fresh produce, an outdoor plunge pool, and a fabulous garden where you will be able to wander and bond with nature.</p>
        
            <p>We offer a range of activities at Lilac Valley Farmstay that guests will be able to participate in. From fruit-picking to maintaining the crops waiting to be harvested in our gardens, you will be able to immerse yourself in the full experience of farm life. Let’s not forget the many animals you will meet throughout your stay. From the cows, to the sheep, to the sheepdogs, to our resident goat, Rosie, all our animals are eager to meet new friends, or rather, meet new people who will fulfill the duties of feeding them. For those who are seeking a getaway of slower pace, we have just the thing for you. Walk along the scenic trails of our farm to watch the sunrise or the sunset, relax in the meadows where you’ll see a variety of flora and fauna, or wait until nighttime to admire the sky brimming with bright and shining stars while sitting by a warm and toasty campfire.</p>
        
            <p>We hope that you visit our farm with the desire to connect with the surrounding nature while appreciating the little things in life, and we’re eager for you to learn more about rural life. We look forward to welcoming you.</p>
